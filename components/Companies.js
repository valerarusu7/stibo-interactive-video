              With the Stibo Accelerator initiative we have created a space to
              dream, discuss, prototype, test, fail, iterate, try again and
              learn. The Stibo Accelerator is first and foremost a Corporate
              Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative launched to give
              inspiration and value back to the academic institutions supplying
              us with the best-qualified future employees and to the industries
              in which our divisions operate.
